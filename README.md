An Android Java SDK app - with the stated purpose of exercising the development. Not a Google Play store app.

Development initially targeted Android 2.3, a long time ago .... using multiple activities, the app's main functionality is a Tic-Tac-Toe game. It also supports user account creation, log in, etc. Tic-Tac-Toe game results and user account information are stored in a SQLiteDatabase.

The application exercises the usage of multiple activities, multi-threading, custom view drawing, SQLiteDatabase, animation and more.
